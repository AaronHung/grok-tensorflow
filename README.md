# Aaron's Tensorflow Notes

This repository is based on the excellent open-source curriculum by [Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning), including his official course site:  
ðŸ“˜ [https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/](https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/)

I've extended the materials by adding:

- ðŸ§  My own study notes and takeaways (Aaron's Tensorflow Notes)
- ðŸ“º Summaries from Udemy/YouTube content
- ðŸ““ Additional explanations and visual references for better understanding

All content is structured to help reinforce deep learning concepts using TensorFlow and Python.
